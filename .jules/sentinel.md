## 2026-01-21 - Standardized Input Validation & Repository Name Security
**Vulnerability:** Inconsistent input validation between CLI and API components, and missing validation for critical external identifiers like GitHub repository names.
**Learning:** Security-critical identifiers (like task IDs or repo names) were being validated with local ad-hoc regexes in some places (CLI) while being entirely unvalidated in others (GitHub webhook). This creates a risk where malicious input could bypass intended restrictions if used in shell commands or file operations (e.g., path traversal via '../' in repo names).
**Prevention:** Always use centralized, shared validation helpers for all external input. New validators (like `validateRepoName`) should be added to the core security module whenever a new type of external identifier is introduced, ensuring 'Defense in Depth' across both API and CLI interfaces.
